# Deep Learningâ€“Based Real-Time Detection of Monkey & Bison Intrusion and Humane Repellent System
This project presents a real-time animal detection system designed to help farmers protect their crops from monkey and bison intrusions.
The system uses YOLOv8 with a Swin Transformer backbone to continuously analyze video feeds and detect animals with high accuracy, even in complex farm environments.
When an intrusion is detected, the system is designed to trigger humane repellent mechanisms (such as ultrasonic deterrents, flashing lights, or alarms) while sending IoT-based alerts (SMS, notifications, or dashboard updates) to farmers for immediate action.
## Project Overview
Wildlife intrusion into farms causes significant crop loss. This project delivers a real-time detection and response pipeline: capture video â†’ detect â†’ decide â†’ alert â†’ log events.
It is designed for PC/edge deployment .

Target animals: Monkey, Bison
## Features
Real-time Object Detection with YOLOv8 + Swin Transformer

Improved accuracy: 90.2% mAP

Low-latency pipeline with OpenCV

Instant alerts via beep

Modular codebase: train, evaluate, infer, deploy

Config-driven (YAML): thresholds, video paths, GPIO pins, alert settings
## Technologies used
Deep Learning : PyTorch + Ultralytics YOLOv8

Backbone Model : Swin Transformer (for high-resolution image analysis)

Programming Language : Python

Libraries/Frameworks : PyTorch, Ultralytics, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Requirements

Windows 10 or higher

Webcam (for live detection)

Optional: video files (.mp4, .avi, .mov)

All Python dependencies are packaged in the EXE, so no Python installation is required.

## Hardware Requirements
Video Input: Pre-recorded or streaming video (no direct camera feed)

Compute: GPU-enabled PC (NVIDIA GPU recommended)

Repellent (any subset):

    Sound driver / buzzer / speaker
Connectivity: Internet (for alerts/cloud), optional offline mode
## Model and Metrics
Backbone: Swin Transformer integrated into YOLOv8

Baseline: YOLOv8n

Updated accuracy with Swin Transformer:

    | Metric | Value | |-------------|---------| | Precision | 90.2% | | Recall | 72.4% | | mAP | 90.2% |

Confidence threshold: 0.8

    mAP@0.5	        92.3%
    mAP@0.5:0.95	78.5%
    Precision	    90.1%
    Recall	        87.6%

Backbone: Swin Transformer integrated into YOLOv8

Baseline Model: YOLOv8m

Confidence Threshold: 0.8
## Troubleshooting
    No last.pt â†’ use save_period=1
    Resume training â†’ resume=True model=path/to/last.pt
    Low FPS â†’ reduce imgsz, use a smaller model (e.g., yolov8n.pt)
    False alarms â†’ increase conf, check dataset labeling
